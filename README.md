Company 1 is a business that operates in various sectors and requires comprehensive visibility into its financial and sales performance.

The Operations Manager has requested a dashboard that provides a clear overview of the company’s key metrics, including monthly expenses, revenue, the top 25 best-selling items, the 10 least-sold items, and the top 10 companies they are partnered with.

To facilitate this, the manager has provided CSV files containing the relevant data, and our task is to create a dynamic dashboard for his quick review. This will help the manager track performance, make data-driven decisions, and optimize partnerships.

We have developed an interactive dashboard based on these requirements. Now, the manager can easily monitor expenses, revenue trends, sales performance, and partnership data at a glance.
